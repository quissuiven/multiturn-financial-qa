senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $ 500 million at a 3.625% ( 3.625 % ) fixed , annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 , 2043 . interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year . the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $ 998 million . on november 1 , 2011 , we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $ 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $ 1.5 billion with lender approval . the facility matures november 1 , 2017 . as of and for the periods ended may 31 , 2015 and 2014 , we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility . we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . if our long- term debt ratings were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase . conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease . changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility . under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants . these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as a minimum capitalization ratio . in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable . as of may 31 , 2015 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future . liquidity is also provided by our $ 1 billion commercial paper program . during the year ended may 31 , 2015 , we did not issue commercial paper , and as of may 31 , 2015 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program . we may issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2016 depending on general corporate needs . we currently have short-term debt ratings of a1+ and p1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . as of may 31 , 2015 , we had cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $ 5.9 billion , of which $ 4.2 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries . included in cash and equivalents as of may 31 , 2015 was $ 968 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity . cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks , money market funds , commercial paper , corporate notes , u.s . treasury obligations , u.s . government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities . our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk . all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk . while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2015 the weighted average remaining duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 79 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations . contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual obligations as of may 31 , 2015 and significant endorsement contracts , including related marketing commitments , entered into through the date of this report are as follows: .",

( 2 ) the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete , sport team and league endorsers of our products . actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods . actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods . in addition to the cash payments , we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use . it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product . the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors , including general playing conditions , the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives . in addition , the costs to design , develop , source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. .",

2011 , $ 241 million in 2012 and $ 784 million in 2013 . the firm did not originate option arms and new originations of option arms were discontinued by washington mutual prior to the date of jpmorgan chase 2019s acquisition of its banking operations . subprime mortgages at december 31 , 2010 were $ 11.3 billion , compared with $ 12.5 billion at december 31 , 2009 . the decrease was due to paydowns and charge-offs on delinquent loans , partially offset by the addition of loans as a result of the adoption of the accounting guidance related to vies . late-stage delinquencies remained elevated but continued to improve , albeit at a slower rate during the second half of the year , while early-stage delinquencies stabilized at an elevated level during this period . nonaccrual loans improved

an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans , and therefore no allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans as of the acquisition date . the firm regularly updates the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected for these loans . probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through the provision for loan losses . probable and significant increases in expected cash flows ( e.g. , decreased principal credit losses , the net benefit of modifications ) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses , with any remaining increase in the expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans . during 2010 , management concluded as part of the firm 2019s regular assessment of the pci pools that it was probable that higher expected principal credit losses would result in a decrease in expected cash flows . accordingly , the firm recognized an aggregate $ 3.4 billion impairment related to the home equity , prime mortgage , option arm and subprime mortgage pci portfolios . as a result of this impairment , the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses for the home equity , prime mortgage , option arm and subprime mortgage pci portfolios was $ 1.6 billion , $ 1.8 billion , $ 1.5 billion and $ 98 million , respectively , at december 31 , 2010 , compared with an allowance for loan losses of $ 1.1 billion and $ 491 million for the prime mortgage and option arm pci portfolios , respectively , at december 31 , 2009 . approximately 39% ( 39 % ) of the option arm borrowers were delinquent , 5% ( 5 % ) were making interest-only or negatively amortizing payments , and 56% ( 56 % ) were making amortizing payments . approximately 50% ( 50 % ) of current borrowers are subject to risk of payment shock due to future payment recast ; substantially all of the remaining loans have been modified to a fixed rate fully amortizing loan . the cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance of the option arm pci pool was $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.9 billion at de- cember 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the firm estimates the following balances of option arm pci loans will experience a recast that results in a payment increase : $ 1.2 billion in 2011 , $ 2.7 billion in 2012 and $ 508 million in 2013 . the following table provides a summary of lifetime loss estimates included in both the nonaccretable difference and the allowance for loan losses . principal charge-offs will not be recorded on these pools until the nonaccretable difference has been fully depleted . lifetime loss estimates ( a ) ltd liquidation losses

this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contin- gent exposure that is expected , based on average portfolio histori- cal experience , to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor . the loan-equivalent amounts of the firm 2019s lending- related commitments were $ 189.9 billion and $ 179.8 billion as of december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . country exposure the firm 2019s wholesale portfolio includes country risk exposures to both developed and emerging markets . the firm seeks to diversify its country exposures , including its credit-related lending , trading and investment activities , whether cross-border or locally funded . country exposure under the firm 2019s internal risk management ap- proach is reported based on the country where the assets of the obligor , counterparty or guarantor are located . exposure amounts , including resale agreements , are adjusted for collateral and for credit enhancements ( e.g. , guarantees and letters of credit ) pro- vided by third parties ; outstandings supported by a guarantor located outside the country or backed by collateral held outside the country are assigned to the country of the enhancement provider . in addition , the effect of credit derivative hedges and other short credit or equity trading positions are taken into consideration . total exposure measures include activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country . the firm also reports country exposure for regulatory purposes following ffiec guidelines , which are different from the firm 2019s internal risk management approach for measuring country expo- sure . for additional information on the ffiec exposures , see cross- border outstandings on page 314 of this annual report . several european countries , including greece , portugal , spain , italy and ireland , have been subject to credit deterioration due to weak- nesses in their economic and fiscal situations . the firm is closely monitoring its exposures to these five countries . aggregate net exposures to these five countries as measured under the firm 2019s internal approach was less than $ 15.0 billion at december 31 , 2010 , with no country representing a majority of the exposure . sovereign exposure in all five countries represented less than half the aggregate net exposure . the firm currently believes its exposure to these five countries is modest relative to the firm 2019s overall risk expo- sures and is manageable given the size and types of exposures to each of the countries and the diversification of the aggregate expo- sure . the firm continues to conduct business and support client activity in these countries and , therefore , the firm 2019s aggregate net exposures may vary over time . in addition , the net exposures may be impacted by changes in market conditions , and the effects of interest rates and credit spreads on market valuations . as part of its ongoing country risk management process , the firm monitors exposure to emerging market countries , and utilizes country stress tests to measure and manage the risk of extreme loss associated with a sovereign crisis . there is no common definition of emerging markets , but the firm generally includes in its definition those countries whose sovereign debt ratings are equivalent to 201ca+ 201d or lower . the table below presents the firm 2019s exposure to its top 10 emerging markets countries based on its internal measure- ment approach . the selection of countries is based solely on the firm 2019s largest total exposures by country and does not represent its view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. .",

            "post_text": "( a ) effective in 2016 , the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows , as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs . the company has accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and , accordingly has accounted for it on a prospective basis . this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation . 2016 vs . 2015 pension expense , excluding special items , decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost , the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains , partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans . special items of $ 7.3 included pension settlement losses of $ 6.4 , special termination benefits of $ 2.0 , and curtailment gains of $ 1.1 . these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions . 2015 vs . 2014 the decrease in pension expense , excluding special items , was due to the impact from expected return on assets , a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption , and lower service cost and interest cost . the decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses , which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate . special items of $ 35.2 included pension settlement losses of $ 21.2 , special termination benefits of $ 8.7 , and curtailment losses of $ 5.3 . these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions . 2017 outlook in 2017 , pension expense , excluding special items , is estimated to be approximately $ 70 to $ 75 , an increase of $ 10 to $ 15 from 2016 , resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates , offset by favorable asset experience , effects of the versum spin-off and the adoption of new mortality tables . pension settlement losses of $ 10 to $ 15 are expected , dependent on the timing of retirements . in 2017 , we expect pension expense to include approximately $ 164 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $ 121 in 2016 . net actuarial losses of $ 484 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2016 , primarily attributable to lower discount rates and improved mortality projections . actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses . future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2017 . during the first quarter of 2017 , the company expects to record a curtailment loss estimated to be $ 5 to $ 10 related to employees transferring to versum . the loss will be reflected in the results from discontinued operations on the consolidated income statements . we continue to evaluate opportunities to manage the liabilities associated with our pension plans . pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans . with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses . in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions . with the assistance of third party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions . during 2016 and 2015 , our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $ 79.3 and $ 137.5 , respectively . for 2017 , cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $ 65 to $ 85 . the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans , which .",

            "pre_text": "liquidity monitoring and measurement stress testing liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citi 2019s major entities , operating subsidiaries and/or countries . stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position , and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized . these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources , market triggers ( such as credit ratings ) , potential uses of funding and geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions . these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as company-specific events . liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions . liquidity limits are set accordingly . to monitor the liquidity of an entity , these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies , with several tests performed daily . given the range of potential stresses , citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities . these plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses . short-term liquidity measurement : liquidity coverage ratio ( lcr ) in addition to internal liquidity stress metrics that citi has developed for a 30-day stress scenario , citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr , as calculated pursuant to the u.s . lcr rules . generally , the lcr is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of hqla to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30-day stress scenario . the lcr is calculated by dividing hqla by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30-day period , with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities , such as deposits , unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings , unused lending commitments and derivatives- related exposures , partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days . banks are required to calculate an add-on to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30-day period in determining the total amount of net outflows . the minimum lcr requirement is 100% ( 100 % ) , effective january 2017 . pursuant to the federal reserve board 2019s final rule regarding lcr disclosures , effective april 1 , 2017 , citi began to disclose lcr in the prescribed format . the table below sets forth the components of citi 2019s lcr calculation and hqla in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated : in billions of dollars dec . 31 , sept . 30 , dec . 31 .",

            "pre_text": "the company has also encountered various quality issues on its aircraft carrier construction and overhaul programs and its virginia-class submarine construction program at its newport news location . these primarily involve matters related to filler metal used in pipe welds identified in 2007 , and issues associated with non-nuclear weld inspection and the installation of weapons handling equipment on certain submarines , and certain purchased material quality issues identified in 2009 . the company does not believe that resolution of these issues will have a material effect upon its consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows . environmental matters 2014the estimated cost to complete environmental remediation has been accrued where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities , or at sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party ( 201cprp 201d ) by the environmental protection agency , or similarly designated by another environmental agency , and these costs can be estimated by management . these accruals do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters , nor do they include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations . to assess the potential impact on the company 2019s consolidated financial statements , management estimates the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by the company , taking into account currently available facts on each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated sites . these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances . management estimates that as of december 31 , 2011 , the probable future costs for environmental remediation is $ 3 million , which is accrued in other current liabilities . factors that could result in changes to the company 2019s estimates include : modification of planned remedial actions , increases or decreases in the estimated time required to remediate , changes to the determination of legally responsible parties , discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated , changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements , and improvements in remediation technology . should other prps not pay their allocable share of remediation costs , the company may have to incur costs exceeding those already estimated and accrued . in addition , there are certain potential remediation sites where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated . although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued , management does not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on the company 2019s consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows . financial arrangements 2014in the ordinary course of business , hii uses standby letters of credit issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance companies principally to support the company 2019s self-insured workers 2019 compensation plans . at december 31 , 2011 , there were $ 121 million of standby letters of credit issued but undrawn and $ 297 million of surety bonds outstanding related to hii . u.s . government claims 2014from time to time , the u.s . government advises the company of claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed costs . when such findings are presented , the company and u.s . government representatives engage in discussions to enable hii to evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to assess the amounts being claimed . the company does not believe that the outcome of any such matters will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows . collective bargaining agreements 2014the company believes that it maintains good relations with its approximately 38000 employees of which approximately 50% ( 50 % ) are covered by a total of 10 collective bargaining agreements . the company expects to renegotiate renewals of each of its collective bargaining agreements between 2013 and 2015 as they approach expiration . collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time . it is not expected that the results of these negotiations , either individually or in the aggregate , will have a material effect on the company 2019s consolidated results of operations . operating leases 2014rental expense for operating leases was $ 44 million in 2011 , $ 44 million in 2010 , and $ 48 million in 2009 . these amounts are net of immaterial amounts of sublease rental income . minimum rental commitments under long- term

january 2006 and the perryville plant coming online in july 2005 ; n an increase of $ 12 million related to storm reserves . this increase does not include costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita ; and n an increase of $ 12 million due to a return to normal expense patterns in 2006 versus the deferral or capitalization of storm costs in 2005 . other operation and maintenance expenses increased for non- utility nuclear from $ 588 million in 2005 to $ 637 million in 2006 primarily due to the timing of refueling outages , increased benefit and insurance costs , and increased nrc fees . taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased for the utility from $ 322 million in 2005 to $ 361 million in 2006 primarily due to an increase in city franchise taxes in arkansas due to a change in 2006 in the accounting for city franchise tax revenues as directed by the apsc . the change results in an increase in taxes other than income taxes with a corresponding increase in rider revenue , resulting in no effect on net income . also contributing to the increase was higher franchise tax expense at entergy gulf states , inc . as a result of higher gross revenues in 2006 and a customer refund in 2005 . other income other income increased for the utility from $ 111 million in 2005 to $ 156 million in 2006 primarily due to carrying charges recorded on storm restoration costs . other income increased for non-utility nuclear primarily due to miscellaneous income of $ 27 million ( $ 16.6 million net-of-tax ) resulting from a reduction in the decommissioning liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study and changes in assumptions regarding the timing of when decommissioning of a plant will begin . other income increased for parent & other primarily due to a gain related to its entergy-koch investment of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) in the fourth quarter of 2006 . in 2004 , entergy-koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third parties . at that time , entergy received $ 862 million of the sales proceeds in the form of a cash distribution by entergy-koch . due to the november 2006 expiration of contingencies on the sale of entergy-koch 2019s trading business , and the corresponding release to entergy-koch of sales proceeds held in escrow , entergy received additional cash distributions of approximately $ 163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and recorded a gain of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) . entergy expects future cash distributions upon liquidation of the partnership will be less than $ 35 million . interest charges interest charges increased for the utility and parent & other primarily due to additional borrowing to fund the significant storm restoration costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita . discontinued operations in april 2006 , entergy sold the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the electric reliability council of texas ( ercot ) region of texas , and now reports this portion of the business as a discontinued operation . earnings for 2005 were negatively affected by $ 44.8 million ( net-of-tax ) of discontinued operations due to the planned sale . this amount includes a net charge of $ 25.8 million ( net-of-tax ) related to the impairment reserve for the remaining net book value of the competitive retail services business 2019 information technology systems . results for 2006 include an $ 11.1 million gain ( net-of-tax ) on the sale of the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the ercot region of texas . income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 27.6% ( 27.6 % ) and 36.6% ( 36.6 % ) , respectively . the lower effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to tax benefits , net of reserves , resulting from the tax capital loss recognized in connection with the liquidation of entergy power international holdings , entergy 2019s holding company for entergy-koch . also contributing to the lower rate for 2006 is an irs audit settlement that allowed entergy to release from its tax reserves all settled issues relating to 1996-1998 audit cycle . see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% ( 35.0 % ) to

facility , along with a decrease in shareholders 2019 equity primarily due to repurchases of common stock . this increase in the debt to capital percentage is in line with entergy 2019s financial and
